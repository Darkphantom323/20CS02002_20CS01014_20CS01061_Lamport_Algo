## Overview
This repository contains the Java implementation of Lamport's Algorithm. The detailed explanation for the code can be found in the report file `20CS02002_20CS01014_20CS01061_CC_Assignment.pdf`.

## Instructions to Run

### Files
There are two main files in this repository:
1. `Main.java`
2. `CriticalSection.java`

### Steps to Run
1. **Run `CriticalSection.java` First**: This file sets up the code that will have access to the critical section.

2. **Running Multiple Processes on the Same PC**:
    - If you are running the processes on the same PC, no changes are needed.
    - Simply run `Main.java` on three different terminals for testing.

3. **Input Configuration**:
    - After running both files, you will see prompts to enter port numbers.
    - Once you run them both you will see something like this

    - After you enter the port numbers you will see the option to do various things.

4. **Running on Multiple Devices**:
    - You can run the algorithm on three separate devices.
    - Input can either be hardcoded into the code or taken as input using a Scanner. We have chosen not to for easier debugging.


## Conclusion
That's it! You are now ready to run Lamport's Algorithm using this Java implementation. Cheers!
